# UVA Forest Model Enhanced

This repository holds the source code for UVAFME. UVAFME is an individual-based forest gap model which simulates the establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on independent gaps or "plots" of a forested landscape. 

For more information about UVAFME see the How To Guide or visit the [UVAFME website](https://uvafme.github.io/).
